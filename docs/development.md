# Development

## Play locally

Use Node **>=24.21.0 <25** (see `package.json` and `.nvmrc`). From the
repository root:

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080.

## Build a portable release

```sh
npm run package
```

Open `release/robbo/index.html` directly, or run `npm run preview` and open
http://127.0.0.1:8080. Stop the development server before starting the preview;
both use port 8080. `dist` and `release` are generated, ignored directories.
Packaging produces a self-contained IIFE, so the game works through `file://`
as well as on GitHub Pages.

## Validate

```sh
npm test
npm run test:tooling
npm run package
npx playwright install chromium firefox
npm run test:dev
npm run test:browser
npm run test:input
npm run test:session-browser
npm run test:viewport
npm run test:artwork
npm run test:performance
```

The release browser commands package the game first; `test:dev` starts Vite on
port 8082 and checks the development entrypoint. To test an already built
release, run the corresponding `tests/browser/*.check.cjs` with Node. Run those
checks sequentially: some start a server on port 8080. Set
`ROBBO_BROWSER=firefox` for the additional viewport check; `ROBBO_CHROMIUM`
optionally selects a Chromium executable.
